# WebGL-Model-Viewer
WebGL based model renderer

The aim of this project is to create a model renderer that will allow you to load models in 3D software, and display them in the browser. 

It was also a good project to learn more about the graphical pipeline. 

I will be adding to this quite often and as i learn more and more about WebGL and 3d programming in general.
